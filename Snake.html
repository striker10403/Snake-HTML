Agenda items for meeting with Jeff:

LAWN ISSUES:

1.	Reseeding that was done last year got washed away the next day due to heavy rains
2.	Water sprinklers were on for adequate amount of time & frequency all through last year. In fact,  some of the owners got warnings in-person and by mail from the Town for excess usage
3.	Jeff mentioned last year that the lawns are acidic due to fallings from the pine trees. Any fix to be done for that?
4.	Jeff says the southerly slope was fixed after vendor change, but there is no grass yet
5.	There is water stagnation on the backyard and sides – Houses #5, #7, #9 and #11
6.	Add tick control to the services
7.	Mulching was not done last year, so owners had to do it themselves
